# Cyber-Security-Portfolio
This consists of the stories I worked on for my final live project for The Tech Academy Cyber Security Bootcamp. I completed a mix of [offensive](#offensive) and [defensive](#defensive) reports over the course of a week and a half. Each report was based off of their own user story of what I needed to accomplish or find. This was done in an Agile environment with daily standups and retrospectives on Friday. This allowed me to get some experience of working on cyber security projects within a possible job environment. 
## Offensive
The offensive stories were done using the OWASP Juice Shop application. I exploited vulnerabilities of the application and wrote reports of my actions which include screenshots of the application and some screenshots from Burp Suite when used. Some of these include SQL injection, DOM XSS attacks, and using Burp Suite to intercept and manipulate HTTP requests. The following are all of the offensive reports that I completed during the live project.

## Defensive
The defensive stories mostly included examining PCAP files through the use of Wireshark and VirusTotal to find the cause of infected computers. I got experience locating where different viruses, payloads, and exploit kits came from and figuring out victim details like their IP address, MAC address, account and host names. I was also able to examine Linux server logs to figure out how the attacker bypassed the security feature. The following are all of the defensive reports I completed during the live project.
